# Why We Made the Fork
We forked existing PDF tools because we believe document editing shouldn’t drain your wallet or lock you into endless subscriptions! 💸 Frustrated by restrictive licenses and complex interfaces, we created Adobo PDFile to offer a free, accessible platform for annotating, highlighting, and managing PDFs with ease. 📚 This is our commitment to empowering users everywhere! 🙌

# Why We’re Against Adobe’s Software Practices
Adobe’s software model—steep subscriptions, hidden costs, and proprietary barriers—puts creativity and productivity out of reach for too many! 🔐 We stand against the corporate chokehold on document tools and champion freedom and flexibility. 🌏 Adobo PDFile is our bold stand against these greedy practices, delivering a no-strings-attached solution! 💥
